# Gaze-Detection

Necessary libraries are: OpenCV>3, NumPy and dlib.

I've used Spyder by Anaconda platform with all necesseray packages. I think, PyCharm would be OK too.

The recorded eye video is placing in the folder called "eye_recording_video.flv".

We are expecting from program to give us s location of the iris even the eyes is moving left and right sides.

Open Gaze_Detection.py and run file.
